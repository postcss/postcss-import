# 6.1.0 - 2015-07-07 **YANKED**

_This release was not respecting semver and introduced a major breaking change.
It has been unpublished for now._

# 6.0.0 - 2015-06-17

- Changed: warnings messages are now using postcss message api (4.1.x)
- Added: warning when a import statement has not been closed correctly
([#42](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import/issues/42))

# 5.2.2 - 2015-04-19

- Fixed: globbed imports work for module directories ([#37](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import/pull/37))

# 5.2.1 - 2015-04-17

- Fixed: glob import now works with single quote `@import` ([#36](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import/pull/36))

# 5.2.0 - 2015-04-15

- Added: plugin can now be added to PostCSS without calling it as a function ([#27](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import/pull/27))

# 5.1.1 - 2015-04-10

- Fixed: regression of 5.1.0: files which only contain same @import rules were skip ([#31](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import/issues/31))

# 5.1.0 - 2015-03-27

- Added: files with the same content will only be imported once. Previously, only the full path was used to determine if a file has already been imported in a given scope.
Now, we also test create a hash with the content of the file to check if a file with the same content has not already been imported.
This might be usefull if some modules you import are importing the same library from different places (eg: normalize might be as dep for several modules located in different places in `node_modules`)
([#29](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import/pull/28))

# 5.0.3 - 2015-02-16

- Fixed: regression of 5.0.2: AST parent references were not updated ([#25](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import/issues/25))

# 5.0.0 - 2015-01-26

- Added: compatibility with postcss v4.x
- Removed: compatibility with postcss v3.x
- Fixed: relative imports (./ and ../) should work using `path` option only (no need for `from`) ([#14](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import/issues/14))

# 4.1.1 - 2015-01-05

- Fixed: irregular whitespace that throw syntax error in some environnements

# 4.1.0 - 2014-12-12

- Added: `web_modules` is now in module directories that are used to resolve `@import` ([#13](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import/issues/13)).

- Added: ability to consume local modules (fix [#12](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import/issues/12))

# 3.0.0 - 2014-11-21

- Added: ability to consume node modules ([ref](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import/issues/7)).
This means you don't have to add `node_modules` in the path anymore (or using `@import "../node_modules/..."`).
Also, `index.css` can be ommited.

This means something like this

```css
@import "../node_modules/my-css-on-npm/index.css";
```

can be written like this

```css
@import "my-css-on-npm";
```

Dependencies of dependencies should be resolved as well.

_Note that npm resolution is done after the default local behavior._

- Changed: When importing a file multiple times in the same scope (same level of media queries), file will only be imported the first time.
This is done to avoid having multiples outputs of a npm dep used multiples times in different modules.

# 2.0.0 - 2014-11-12

- Added: compatibility with postcss v3.x
- Removed: compatibility with postcss v2.x

# 1.0.3 - 2014-10-29
